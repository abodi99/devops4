Assuming 50 simultaneous users:
◦ What are 90th percentile of the response time for the different operations (add, subtract...)?

Type	Name	90%ile (ms)
POST	add	62
POST	divide	53
POST	multiply	32
POST	subtract	35
	Aggregated	46


◦ What is the throughput? That is, how many requests/second is performed with this user
load?

Type	Name	# Requests	Current RPS
POST	add	904	6.1
POST	divide	468	4
POST	multiply	444	2.7
POST	subtract	448	3.3
Aggregated	2264	74	0.1


• How many simultaneous users can the application handle and still reliably provide responses?
3000-3300 

• What is the maximum throughput the Calculator application can achieve and still reliably
provide responses?
280-300

Also, during the trial period the customer have experienced two different problems:
1. Sometimes the response time when performing the add operation seemed to be slower than
usual. It didn’t seem to be related to the number of simultaneous users, but no other clues were
given. Can you figure out under what circumstances the problem may occur?

the response returns a status code 0 and 

2. The application seemed to crash from time to time. When it happened the application had to be
restarted and then everything went back to normal. Can you repoduce the problem and inform
the developers what seems to cause the problem? What part of the application is triggering the
problem?

Server ran out of resourses
